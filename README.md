# Shoe-Store
From Read Me and down is what neccessary, this is similar to your project since it was inspired in order to complete the project overall. This does not have the images but has everything else. The .pug and .pug~ are for the HTMLs for the website. Routing.js shows the POST and GET neccesary for the website and dbManager.js is also simalr since I needed the mongoDB. StoreSite is for the main set up in order for the code to work.
